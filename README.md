Logistics for Last Seminar



Logistics for tomorrow are as follows. We'll have a tight schedule, so let's make sure to do the best we can to stay aligned and brief. This time, I'll make sure to have all presentations queued up on my laptop so there's little time lost in switching. To ensure this runs smoothly, *email me your presentations or anything thing you hope to demo by 2pm tomorrow*.
